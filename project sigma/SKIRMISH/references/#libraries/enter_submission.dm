			This isn't exactly detrimental to the library, but it's how I've handled form submission instead of adding buttons to the screen.
		You can use this if you'd like, if not just put the appropriate date handling parts from below into your buttons or wherever you want to
		collect input data.

		What it does is let the player submit their data by hitting enter when entering text to an input.
