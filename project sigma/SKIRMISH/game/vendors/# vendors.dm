/* All of this stuff pretty much just builds the containers for the vendors.  Hopefully it should all be pretty self-explanatory and really you
shouldn't even need to touch it.  All of the vendor-specific stuff is handled in their designated vendor files.
On that note, I didn't set prices or descriptions at all for anything except guns and specials and I mostly only did those so I could test
and make sure they worked properly.  You're on your own for the rest. :p */
